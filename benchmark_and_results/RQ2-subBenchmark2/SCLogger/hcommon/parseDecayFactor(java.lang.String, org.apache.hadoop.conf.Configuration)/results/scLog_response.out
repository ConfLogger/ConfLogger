Given the examples provided and the target code, a suitable logging statement following the patterns observed could be inserted after the initial retrieval of the decay factor to log its value. This would be useful for debugging purposes, especially to verify that the configuration is being read correctly. Following the pattern from the examples, particularly the use of `LOG.debug` for logging debug-level information, the insertion could be as follows:

```java
<Line#2> IPC_FCQ_DECAYSCHEDULER_FACTOR_KEY, 0.0);
<Line#2.1>:# LOG.debug("Decay factor retrieved: " + factor);:#
<Line#3> if (factor == 0.0) {
```

This logging statement is inserted right after the factor is initially retrieved from the configuration, providing immediate feedback on the value obtained before any further logic is applied. This follows the demonstrated pattern of logging significant steps or values in the process for clarity and debugging ease.
