To insert a logging statement into the provided target code using the patterns from the examples, we can follow the approach demonstrated in Example 2 and Example 3, which checks if debug logging is enabled before logging debug information. This approach is efficient as it prevents unnecessary string concatenation when debug logging is disabled. Given the context of the target code, which involves retrieving and potentially logging password information, we should be cautious not to log sensitive information directly. However, we can log the status of password retrieval without exposing the password itself.

Inserting a logging statement after the password has been successfully retrieved or defaulted can be informative. We'll add a debug log statement after the password is set, either from the configuration or as the default, to indicate the completion of the operation without exposing sensitive information.

```java
<Line#6>       password=new String(passchars);
<Line#6.1>:#     if (LOG.isDebugEnabled()) { LOG.debug("Password retrieved for alias: " + alias); }#:
<Line#7>   }
```

And for the catch block, to log when an exception occurs during password retrieval:

```java
<Line#8>  catch (  IOException ioe) {
<Line#8.1>:#     LOG.error("Failed to retrieve password for alias: " + alias, ioe);#:
<Line#8.2>  }
```

These logging statements provide useful information about the flow of the password retrieval process without compromising security by exposing the actual password. The first log statement indicates a successful retrieval or fallback to the default password, and the second log statement helps in diagnosing issues when the password retrieval fails due to an `IOException`.
