To insert a log level and log verbosity message into the given target method code, we need to identify where logging would be appropriate, such as in catch blocks or conditional branches where a significant event or error occurs. Here is the modified code with log statements added:

```java
<Line#0>if (clazz != null) {
<Line#1>    return ReflectionUtils.newInstance(clazz, conf);
<Line#2>}
<Line#3>try {
<Line#4>    return new ResourceCalculatorPlugin();
<Line#5>} catch (UnsupportedOperationException ue) {
<Line#6>    LOG.warn("Unsupported operation encountered while creating ResourceCalculatorPlugin.", ue);
<Line#7>} catch (Throwable t) {
<Line#8>    LOG.error("Unexpected error occurred while creating ResourceCalculatorPlugin.", t);
<Line#9>}
<Line#10>return null;
<Line#11>}
```

In the code above:
- At `<Line#6>`, a warning log level is used to indicate an unsupported operation exception, which might not be critical but is worth noting.
- At `<Line#8>`, an error log level is used for any unexpected throwable, indicating a more severe issue that needs attention.

These log statements provide context and detail about what went wrong, aiding in debugging and monitoring the application's behavior.
