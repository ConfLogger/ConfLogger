To insert a log level and log verbosity message into the given target method code, we need to identify a suitable line for logging and insert a log statement. Based on the pattern observed in the examples, logging is usually added in places where there is a potential error or important decision point, such as inside a conditional block or catch block. In this scenario, an appropriate place to add a log message would be after the `if` statement where `value` is set to `conf.getLong(schedulerKey, schedulerDefault);` if the initial `conf.getLong(resourceTypesKey, -1L);` returns `-1L`.

Below is the modified code with a log statement added:

```java
<Line#0>String resourceTypesKey, String schedulerKey, long schedulerDefault) {
<Line#1>long value = conf.getLong(resourceTypesKey, -1L);
<Line#2>if (value == -1) {
<Line#3>  value = conf.getLong(schedulerKey, schedulerDefault);
<Line#3.1>  LOG.info("Default scheduler value used: " + value);
<Line#4>}
<Line#5>return value;
<Line#6>}
```

**Label:** `<Line#3.1> LOG.info("Default scheduler value used: " + value);`

This log statement provides information that the default scheduler value is being used, which can be useful for debugging or understanding the flow of the application.
