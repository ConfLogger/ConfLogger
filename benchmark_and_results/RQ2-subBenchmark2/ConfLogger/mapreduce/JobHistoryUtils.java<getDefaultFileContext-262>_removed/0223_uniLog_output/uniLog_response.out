In the provided code snippet, the task is to select a line and insert a log level and log verbosity message. Based on the examples provided, it seems you want to identify lines where logging statements are present and label them with their respective log levels and messages.

For the given "Target method code", the logging statement is already present at:

```java
<Line#15>LOG.info("Default file system is set solely " +
<Line#16>"by core-default.xml therefore -  ignoring");
```

Based on the pattern from your examples, the label for this log statement should be:

Label: `<Line#15> LOG.info("Default file system is set solely by core-default.xml therefore -  ignoring")`

This label indicates the line number, log level, and the message being logged, similar to the examples you provided.
