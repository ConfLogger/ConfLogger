To insert a log level and log verbosity message in the target method code, we need to select the appropriate line and insert a logging statement. Based on the examples provided, it looks like logging statements are typically inserted to provide information about the execution state or errors.

For the given method `getCompletionPollInterval`, we can insert a logging statement at line 3, where a check is performed to ensure the interval is not less than 1. If it is, the default value is used. This is a good place to log a warning message since using a default value might indicate a potential configuration issue.

Here is how the code would look with the inserted logging statement:

```java
<Line#0>public static int getCompletionPollInterval(Configuration conf) {
<Line#1>int completionPollIntervalMillis = conf.getInt(
<Line#2>COMPLETION_POLL_INTERVAL_KEY, DEFAULT_COMPLETION_POLL_INTERVAL);
<Line#3>if (completionPollIntervalMillis < 1) {
<Line#3.1>    LOG.warn("Completion poll interval is less than 1, using default value: " + DEFAULT_COMPLETION_POLL_INTERVAL);
<Line#4>completionPollIntervalMillis = DEFAULT_COMPLETION_POLL_INTERVAL;
<Line#5>}
<Line#6>return completionPollIntervalMillis;
<Line#7>}
```

In this insertion:
- The log level is `warn`, which indicates a potential issue that does not stop the execution.
- The log message provides information about the fallback to the default value of the completion poll interval.
