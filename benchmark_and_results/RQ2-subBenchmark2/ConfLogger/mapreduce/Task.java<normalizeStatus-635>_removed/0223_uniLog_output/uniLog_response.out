To insert log level and log verbosity message in the target method code, we need to identify appropriate lines where logging would be meaningful. Based on the examples, logging is often added before or after significant operations or decisions, such as checking conditions, handling exceptions, or returning from methods. Let's add logging to the provided code:

```java
<Line#0>// and truncate it if needed.
<Line#1>int progressStatusLength = conf.getInt(
<Line#2>MRConfig.PROGRESS_STATUS_LEN_LIMIT_KEY,
<Line#3>MRConfig.PROGRESS_STATUS_LEN_LIMIT_DEFAULT);
<Line#4>if (status.length() > progressStatusLength) {
<Line#5>    LOG.debug("Truncating status to " + progressStatusLength + " characters."); // Log level: DEBUG
<Line#6>    status = status.substring(0, progressStatusLength);
<Line#7>}
<Line#8>LOG.info("Returning status: " + status); // Log level: INFO
<Line#9>return status;
<Line#10>}
```

Explanation:
- **Line#5**: Added a debug log before truncating the status to indicate the truncation operation and the length it is being truncated to.
- **Line#8**: Added an info log before returning the status to log the final status being returned.
