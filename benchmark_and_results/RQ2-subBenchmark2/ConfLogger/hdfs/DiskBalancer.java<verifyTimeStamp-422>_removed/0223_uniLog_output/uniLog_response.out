To insert log level and log verbosity messages into the provided method, we need to identify where logging would be most appropriate. In this case, we can add logging at key decision points and error handling sections. Here's how you can incorporate logging into the `verifyTimeStamp` method:

```java
<Line#0>private void verifyTimeStamp(NodePlan plan) throws DiskBalancerException {
<Line#1>  long now = Time.now();
<Line#2>  long planTime = plan.getTimeStamp();
<Line#3>  LOG.debug("Current time: {}, Plan timestamp: {}", now, planTime); // Log the current and plan timestamps
<Line#4>
<Line#5>  if ((planTime + planValidityInterval) < now) {
<Line#6>    LOG.warn("Plan is older than the validity interval. Plan time: {}, Current time: {}", planTime, now); // Log a warning if the plan is outdated
<Line#7>    String planValidity = config.get(
<Line#8>        DFSConfigKeys.DFS_DISK_BALANCER_PLAN_VALID_INTERVAL,
<Line#9>        DFSConfigKeys.DFS_DISK_BALANCER_PLAN_VALID_INTERVAL_DEFAULT);
<Line#10>   LOG.debug("Plan validity interval: {}", planValidity); // Log the plan validity interval
<Line#11>   if (planValidity.matches("[0-9]$")) {
<Line#12>     planValidity += "ms";
<Line#13>     LOG.debug("Adjusted plan validity with ms: {}", planValidity); // Log the adjusted plan validity
<Line#14>   }
<Line#15>   throw new DiskBalancerException(errorString,
<Line#16>       DiskBalancerException.Result.OLD_PLAN_SUBMITTED);
<Line#17> }
<Line#18>}
```

### Explanation:

- **Line#3:** Added a debug log to capture the current system time and the timestamp of the plan being verified.
- **Line#6:** Added a warning log to indicate that the plan is older than the allowed validity interval.
- **Line#10:** Added a debug log to show what the plan validity interval is set to.
- **Line#13:** Added a debug log to indicate that the plan validity interval was adjusted to include milliseconds.

These logging lines provide insights into the function's operation, especially when diagnosing issues related to plan timestamps and their validity.
