To insert a log level and log verbosity message in the target method code, we need to identify a suitable line for logging and determine the appropriate log level and message. Based on the examples provided, it seems that logging is typically inserted at significant points in the code, such as after important configurations or actions, using `LOG.info()` or `LOG.warn()` with a descriptive message.

For the given target method code, a suitable place to insert a log message would be after the security login operation, as this is a critical step. We can place a log message after `<Line#10>` to indicate that the login operation was attempted:

```java
<Line#0>throws IOException {
<Line#1>if (conf.getBoolean(DFSConfigKeys.DFS_BALANCER_KEYTAB_ENABLED_KEY,
<Line#2>DFSConfigKeys.DFS_BALANCER_KEYTAB_ENABLED_DEFAULT)) {
<Line#3>UserGroupInformation.setConfiguration(conf);
<Line#4>String addr = conf.get(DFSConfigKeys.DFS_BALANCER_ADDRESS_KEY,
<Line#5>DFSConfigKeys.DFS_BALANCER_ADDRESS_DEFAULT);
<Line#6>InetSocketAddress socAddr = NetUtils.createSocketAddr(addr, 0,
<Line#7>DFSConfigKeys.DFS_BALANCER_ADDRESS_KEY);
<Line#8>SecurityUtil.login(conf, DFSConfigKeys.DFS_BALANCER_KEYTAB_FILE_KEY,
<Line#9>DFSConfigKeys.DFS_BALANCER_KERBEROS_PRINCIPAL_KEY,
<Line#10>socAddr.getHostName());
<Line#11>LOG.info("Security login attempted for host: {}", socAddr.getHostName());
<Line#12>}
<Line#13>}
```

**Label: `<Line#11> LOG.info("Security login attempted for host: {}", socAddr.getHostName())`**

In this context, `LOG.info` is used as the log level to indicate an informational message about the security login attempt, which is a critical operation in the code.
