To insert a log level and log verbosity message into the provided target method code, we need to identify a suitable location within the code where logging would be beneficial. Let's consider inserting a log message at a point where a decision is made or an important action occurs.

In the provided code, a suitable place for logging is right after checking if the `oldStyleUgi` is not null, as this indicates that we're using a deprecated configuration key. We can log this as a warning to inform developers or users about the usage of deprecated configurations.

Here's how we can do it:

```java
<Line#0>static String getUsernameFromConf(Configuration conf) {
<Line#1>String oldStyleUgi = conf.get(DEPRECATED_UGI_KEY);
<Line#2>if (oldStyleUgi != null) {
<Line#2.1>  LOG.warn("Using deprecated configuration key: " + DEPRECATED_UGI_KEY);
<Line#3>// We can't use the normal configuration deprecation mechanism here
<Line#4>// since we need to split out the username from the configured UGI.
<Line#5>String[] parts = oldStyleUgi.split(",");
<Line#6>return parts[0];
<Line#7>} else {
<Line#8>return conf.get(HADOOP_HTTP_STATIC_USER,
<Line#9>DEFAULT_HADOOP_HTTP_STATIC_USER);
```

### Explanation:
- **Log Level**: `LOG.warn` is used because using a deprecated configuration key is not an error but a situation that should be brought to attention.
- **Log Verbosity Message**: The message `"Using deprecated configuration key: " + DEPRECATED_UGI_KEY` provides context about what is being logged, making it easier to understand the log output.

This log entry will help in identifying when the deprecated configuration key is being used, allowing developers or users to take appropriate action to update their configurations.
