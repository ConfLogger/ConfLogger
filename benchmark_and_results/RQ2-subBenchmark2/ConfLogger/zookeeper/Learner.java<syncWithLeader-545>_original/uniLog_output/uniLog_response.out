To select a line and insert a log level and log verbosity message, let's follow the pattern shown in the examples. We'll choose a line from the provided code and add a log message after it. For this example, I will choose `<Line#81>` and insert a log message after it:

```java
<Line#80>                responseReceivedLatch.countDown();
<Line#81>              }
<Line#82>            }
<Line#83>,null);
<Line#84>          }
<Line#85>        }
<Line#86>      }
<Line#87>;
<Line#88>      clientThread.start();
<Line#89>      LOG.info("started thread to issue {} async requests", totalRequestsNum);
<Line#90>      assertTrue(responseReceivedLatch.await(60, TimeUnit.SECONDS));
<Line#91>      LOG.info("received all {} responses", totalRequestsNum);
<Line#92>      stopped.set(true);
<Line#93>      enableDisableThread.join();
<Line#94>      LOG.info("enable and disable recv thread exited");
<Line#95>      LOG.info("waiting another 1s for the requests to go through");
<Line#96>      Thread.sleep(1000);
<Line#97>      assertEquals(successResponse.get(), totalRequestsNum);
```

Now, let's insert a log message after `<Line#81>`:

```java
<Line#81>              }
<Line#82>              LOG.debug("Data callback processResult executed with rc: {}", rc);
<Line#83>            }
``` 

This log message is inserted to provide debug-level verbosity, indicating that the `processResult` method in the data callback has been executed, and it logs the return code (`rc`).
