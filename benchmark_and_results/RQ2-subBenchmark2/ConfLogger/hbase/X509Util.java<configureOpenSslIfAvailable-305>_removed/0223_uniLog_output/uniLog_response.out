To insert log level and log verbosity messages into the provided target method code, you can follow the pattern from the examples. Typically, logging is added to provide insights into the execution flow or to capture important events or errors. Here's how you could add logging to the target method code:

```java
<Line#0>Configuration conf) {
<Line#1>if (OpenSsl.isAvailable() && conf.getBoolean(TLS_USE_OPENSSL, true)) {
<Line#1.1>if (LOG.isDebugEnabled()) {
<Line#1.2>    LOG.debug("OpenSSL is available and configuration allows its use.");
<Line#1.3>}
<Line#2>sslContextBuilder.sslProvider(SslProvider.OPENSSL);
<Line#2.1>if (LOG.isInfoEnabled()) {
<Line#2.2>    LOG.info("SSL context is set to use OpenSSL.");
<Line#2.3>}
<Line#3>return true;
<Line#4>} else {
<Line#4.1>if (LOG.isDebugEnabled()) {
<Line#4.2>    LOG.debug("OpenSSL is not available or configuration disallows its use, falling back to JDK SSL provider.");
<Line#4.3>}
<Line#5>sslContextBuilder.sslProvider(SslProvider.JDK);
<Line#5.1>if (LOG.isInfoEnabled()) {
<Line#5.2>    LOG.info("SSL context is set to use JDK SSL provider.");
<Line#5.3>}
<Line#6>return false;
<Line#7>}
```

### Explanation:
- **Line#1.1 to Line#1.3**: Added a debug log to indicate that OpenSSL is available and the configuration permits its use.
- **Line#2.1 to Line#2.3**: Added an info log to confirm that the SSL context is set to use OpenSSL.
- **Line#4.1 to Line#4.3**: Added a debug log to indicate that either OpenSSL is not available or the configuration disallows its use, hence falling back to JDK SSL provider.
- **Line#5.1 to Line#5.3**: Added an info log to confirm that the SSL context is set to use the JDK SSL provider.

This approach follows the pattern observed in the examples, using appropriate log levels (`DEBUG` and `INFO`) based on the context of the message.
