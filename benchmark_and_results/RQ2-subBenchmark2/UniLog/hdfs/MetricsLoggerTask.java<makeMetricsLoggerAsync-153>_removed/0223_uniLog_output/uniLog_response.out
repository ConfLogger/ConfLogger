To insert a log level and log verbosity message in the provided code, we need to identify the appropriate places in the `makeMetricsLoggerAsync` method where logging might be useful. Based on the examples, logging is often inserted at decision points, error handling, or significant state changes.

Here is how you might add logging to the `makeMetricsLoggerAsync` method:

```java
<Line#0>public static void makeMetricsLoggerAsync(Log metricsLog) {
<Line#1>if (!(metricsLog instanceof Log4JLogger)) {
<Line#2>    LOG.warn("Provided log is not an instance of Log4JLogger. Exiting method.");
<Line#3>return;
<Line#4>}
<Line#5>org.apache.log4j.Logger logger = ((Log4JLogger) metricsLog).getLogger();
<Line#6>logger.setAdditivity(false); // Don't pollute actual logs with metrics dump
<Line#7>LOG.debug("Logger additivity set to false to prevent metrics dump pollution.");
<Line#8>
<Line#9>@SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
<Line#10>List<Appender> appenders = Collections.list(logger.getAllAppenders());
<Line#11>LOG.info("Retrieved all appenders from the logger. Total appenders: " + appenders.size());
<Line#12>// failsafe against trying to async it more than once
<Line#13>if (!appenders.isEmpty() && !(appenders.get(0) instanceof AsyncAppender)) {
<Line#14>    LOG.debug("No AsyncAppender found. Proceeding to wrap appenders with AsyncAppender.");
<Line#15>AsyncAppender asyncAppender = new AsyncAppender();
<Line#16>// change logger to have an async appender containing all the
<Line#17>// previously configured appenders
<Line#18>for (Appender appender : appenders) {
<Line#19>    logger.removeAppender(appender);
<Line#20>    asyncAppender.addAppender(appender);
<Line#21>    LOG.debug("Moved appender " + appender.getName() + " to AsyncAppender.");
<Line#22>}
<Line#23>logger.addAppender(asyncAppender);
<Line#24>LOG.info("AsyncAppender added to the logger.");
<Line#25>}
<Line#26>}
<Line#27>}
```

In this modified code:
- A `LOG.warn` statement is added at line 2 to log a warning when the provided `metricsLog` is not an instance of `Log4JLogger`.
- A `LOG.debug` statement is added at line 7 to log when the logger's additivity is set to false.
- A `LOG.info` statement is added at line 11 to log the number of appenders retrieved.
- A `LOG.debug` statement is added at line 14 to log when the method is about to wrap appenders with an `AsyncAppender`.
- A `LOG.debug` statement is added inside the loop at line 21 to log each appender being moved to the `AsyncAppender`.
- A `LOG.info` statement is added at line 24 to log when the `AsyncAppender` is added to the logger.
