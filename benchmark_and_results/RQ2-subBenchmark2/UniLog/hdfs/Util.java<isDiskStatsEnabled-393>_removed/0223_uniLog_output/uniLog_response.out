To determine the appropriate log level and verbosity message for the given code, we need to analyze the context and purpose of each line. The log level is typically chosen based on the severity or importance of the message, while the verbosity message provides additional context.

Given your code snippet:

```java
<Line#0>final boolean isEnabled;
<Line#1>if (fileIOSamplingPercentage <= 0) {
<Line#2>isEnabled = false;
<Line#3>} else {
<Line#4>isEnabled = true;
<Line#5>}
<Line#6>
<Line#7>return isEnabled;
<Line#8>}
```

Let's select a line and insert a log level and verbosity message:

### Selected Line:
Let's select `<Line#1>` to insert a log statement.

### Log Level and Message:
1. **Log Level:** INFO
   - **Reason:** The log level INFO is appropriate here as it provides general information about the decision-making process within the method.

2. **Verbosity Message:** "File IO sampling percentage is non-positive, disabling feature."
   - **Reason:** This message gives context about why the feature is being disabled.

### Updated Code:
```java
<Line#0>final boolean isEnabled;
<Line#1>if (fileIOSamplingPercentage <= 0) {
<Line#1.1>    LOG.info("File IO sampling percentage is non-positive, disabling feature.");
<Line#2>isEnabled = false;
<Line#3>} else {
<Line#4>isEnabled = true;
<Line#5>}
<Line#6>
<Line#7>return isEnabled;
<Line#8>}
```

This log statement provides insight into the decision made by the code, which can be useful for debugging and understanding the flow of the program.
