To insert a log level and log verbosity message into the specified line of the given code, follow the pattern shown in the examples. The examples show different log levels like `LOG.info`, `LOG.warn`, `LOG.error`, and `LOG.debug` with appropriate messages. In the provided code, there is already a debug log message at `<Line#48>`. If you want to add another log message at a different line, you need to decide on the log level and the message content based on the context.

For instance, let's say you want to add a log message after `<Line#15>`. Here's how you could do it:

```java
<Line#15>if (strNodes != null) {
<Line#16>  LOG.warn("Deprecated configuration key '" + deprecatedKey + "' is set to: " + strNodes);
<Line#17>}
```

In this case, a `LOG.warn` is used to indicate that a deprecated configuration key is being used, which might be important for developers to notice. The verbosity of the message provides specific information about the deprecated key and its value.

Make sure to choose the appropriate log level (`debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`) based on the importance and severity of the message you want to convey.
