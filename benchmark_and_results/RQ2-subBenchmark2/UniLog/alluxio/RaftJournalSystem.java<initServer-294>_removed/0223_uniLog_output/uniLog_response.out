To insert a log level and log verbosity message after a specific line in the provided target method code, you need to identify where the log message should be placed. Based on the examples provided, it seems that the log messages are typically inserted after significant operations or checks, often providing information about the process or state of the system.

Let's select a few lines from the provided target method code where it would be appropriate to add log messages and insert them:

1. **After Line#4**: When the `mStateMachine` is initialized.
   ```java
   <Line#4>mStateMachine = new JournalStateMachine(mJournals, this, mStateMachineStorage);
   LOG.info("StateMachine initialized.");
   ```

2. **After Line#13**: When the RPC port is set.
   ```java
   <Line#13>GrpcConfigKeys.Server.setPort(properties, mLocalAddress.getPort());
   LOG.info("RPC port set to {}", mLocalAddress.getPort());
   ```

3. **After Line#22**: After logging the creation of the journal with a max segment size.
   ```java
   <Line#22>LOG.debug("Creating journal with max segment size {}", segmentSize);
   LOG.info("Max segment size for journal set.");
   ```

4. **After Line#56**: When overriding election timeout for a single master cluster.
   ```java
   <Line#56>LOG.info("Overriding election timeout to {}ms for single master cluster.", SINGLE_MASTER_ELECTION_TIMEOUT_MS);
   LOG.info("Election timeout overridden for single master cluster.");
   ```

5. **After Line#136**: After registering Ratis metric reporters.
   ```java
   <Line#136>RatisDropwizardExports.registerRatisMetricReporters(mRatisMetricsMap);
   LOG.info("Ratis metric reporters registered.");
   ```

These log messages provide information about the state and actions of the method, which can be useful for debugging and understanding the flow of the program.
