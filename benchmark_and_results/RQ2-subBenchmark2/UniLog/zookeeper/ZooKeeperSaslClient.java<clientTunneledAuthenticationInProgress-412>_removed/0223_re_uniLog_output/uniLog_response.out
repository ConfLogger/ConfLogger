To insert log level and log verbosity messages into the provided code, we can follow the pattern shown in the examples. Typically, log messages are inserted at key decision points or before/after significant operations. Here's how you can add log statements to the `clientTunneledAuthenticationInProgress` method:

```java
<Line#0>public boolean clientTunneledAuthenticationInProgress() {
<Line#1>if (!isSASLConfigured) {
<Line#2>LOG.debug("SASL not configured, returning false"); // Log level: DEBUG
<Line#3>return false;
<Line#4>}
<Line#5>// TODO: Rather than checking a disjunction here, should be a single member
<Line#6>// variable or method in this class to determine whether the client is
<Line#7>// configured to use SASL. (see also ZOOKEEPER-1455).
<Line#8>try {
<Line#9>if ((clientConfig.getJaasConfKey() != null)
<Line#10>&& (Configuration.getConfiguration() != null)
<Line#11>&& (Configuration.getConfiguration().getAppConfigurationEntry(
<Line#12>clientConfig.getProperty(
<Line#13>ZKClientConfig.LOGIN_CONTEXT_NAME_KEY,
<Line#14>ZKClientConfig.LOGIN_CONTEXT_NAME_KEY_DEFAULT)) != null))) {
<Line#15>LOG.debug("Client is configured with a valid login configuration"); // Log level: DEBUG
<Line#16>// Client is configured to use a valid login Configuration, so
<Line#17>// authentication is either in progress, successful, or failed.
<Line#18>
<Line#19>// 1. Authentication hasn't finished yet: we must wait for it to do so.
<Line#20>if (!isComplete() && !isFailed()) {
<Line#21>LOG.info("Authentication in progress, waiting for completion"); // Log level: INFO
<Line#22>return true;
<Line#23>}
<Line#24>
<Line#25>// 2. SASL authentication has succeeded or failed..
<Line#26>//noinspection RedundantIfStatement
<Line#27>if (!gotLastPacket) {
<Line#28>LOG.info("Authentication in progress, waiting for last packet"); // Log level: INFO
<Line#29>// ..but still in progress, because there is a final SASL
<Line#30>// message from server which must be received.
<Line#31>return true;
<Line#32>}
<Line#33>}
<Line#34>// Either client is not configured to use a tunnelled authentication
<Line#35>// scheme, or tunnelled authentication has completed (successfully or
<Line#36>// not), and all server SASL messages have been received.
<Line#37>LOG.debug("Tunnelled authentication not configured or completed, returning false"); // Log level: DEBUG
<Line#38>return false;
<Line#39>} catch (SecurityException e) {
<Line#40>LOG.warn("SecurityException caught, returning false", e); // Log level: WARN
<Line#41>// Thrown if the caller does not have permission to retrieve the Configuration.
<Line#42>// In this case, simply returning false is correct.
<Line#43>
<Line#44>return false;
<Line#45>}
```

In this modified version, I've added log statements at key decision points to provide insight into the flow of the method. The log levels are chosen based on the significance of the message:
- `DEBUG` for routine checks and configurations.
- `INFO` for significant state changes or operations in progress.
- `WARN` for exceptions that are caught but handled gracefully.
