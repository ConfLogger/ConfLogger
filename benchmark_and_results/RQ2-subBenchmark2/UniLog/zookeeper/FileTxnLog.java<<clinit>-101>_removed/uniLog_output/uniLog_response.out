To insert a log level and verbosity message in the target method code, we can analyze the given examples to understand the pattern. It appears that the logging is added with a `LOG.info` statement, providing some context about the operation or state of the program.

Let's apply this pattern to the target method code by adding a logging statement at an appropriate place. Since there is no specific line number given for insertion, I'll choose a logical place within the static block initialization, where significant operations are being performed.

Here's how you can insert a log level and verbosity message:

```java
<Line#27>static {
<Line#28>LOG = LoggerFactory.getLogger(FileTxnLog.class);
<Line#29>LOG.info("Initializing FileTxnLog static block"); // Log level and verbosity message added
<Line#30>/** Local variable to read fsync.warningthresholdms into */
<Line#31>Long fsyncWarningThreshold;
<Line#32>if ((fsyncWarningThreshold = Long.getLong(ZOOKEEPER_FSYNC_WARNING_THRESHOLD_MS_PROPERTY)) == null) {
<Line#33>fsyncWarningThreshold = Long.getLong(FSYNC_WARNING_THRESHOLD_MS_PROPERTY, 1000);
<Line#34>}
<Line#35>fsyncWarningThresholdMS = fsyncWarningThreshold;
<Line#36>
<Line#37>Long logSize = Long.getLong(txnLogSizeLimitSetting, -1);
<Line#38>if (logSize > 0) {
<Line#39>// Convert to bytes
<Line#40>logSize = logSize * 1024;
<Line#41>txnLogSizeLimit = logSize;
<Line#42>}
<Line#43>}
```

In this example, the log statement is added after the logger initialization, providing a message that indicates the start of the static block initialization. This follows the pattern of using `LOG.info` to provide informative messages about the process flow.
