To insert a log level and log verbosity message into the provided code, we need to identify a suitable location for logging based on the context provided. Since the code is related to setting up configurations and limits, a logical place to insert logging would be after the configuration values are set, which would be informative for debugging or monitoring purposes.

Let's insert a log message after setting the `fsyncWarningThresholdMS` and `txnLogSizeLimit` to indicate the values being set.

```java
<Line#35>fsyncWarningThresholdMS = fsyncWarningThreshold;
<Line#36>LOG.info("Fsync warning threshold set to {} ms", fsyncWarningThresholdMS); // Log level: INFO, Verbosity: Configuration value set

<Line#41>txnLogSizeLimit = logSize;
<Line#42>LOG.info("Transaction log size limit set to {} bytes", txnLogSizeLimit); // Log level: INFO, Verbosity: Configuration value set
```

Here, I've added two log statements:
- After setting the `fsyncWarningThresholdMS`, a log statement to indicate the configured warning threshold.
- After calculating and setting the `txnLogSizeLimit`, a log statement to indicate the configured log size limit.

These log messages provide insight into the configuration values being used by the system, which can be helpful for debugging and monitoring purposes.
