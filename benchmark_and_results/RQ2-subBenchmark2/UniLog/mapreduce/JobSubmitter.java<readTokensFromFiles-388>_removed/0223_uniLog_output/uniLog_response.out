To insert log level and log verbosity messages into the given code, let's analyze the examples provided. The examples show various log levels like `info`, `debug`, `warn`, and `error` being used to log messages. The log level is typically determined by the importance and type of the message being logged.

In the target method code, there are two distinct sections where logging could be beneficial:

1. When loading tokens from a binary file.
2. When loading secret keys from a JSON file.

Given the context:

- **Info Level Logging**: This is typically used for informational messages that highlight the progress of the application. It's appropriate for logging successful operations like loading tokens or secrets.

- **Warn or Error Level Logging**: These are used for logging potential issues or errors. Since the provided code handles exceptions but does not log them, it might be beneficial to add logging for exceptions.

Here's how you can insert log level and log verbosity messages into the target method code:

```java
// add tokens and secrets coming from a token storage file
String binaryTokenFilename = conf.get(MRJobConfig.MAPREDUCE_JOB_CREDENTIALS_BINARY);
if (binaryTokenFilename != null) {
    LOG.info("Loading tokens from binary file: " + binaryTokenFilename); // Info level logging
    Credentials binary = Credentials.readTokenStorageFile(
        FileSystem.getLocal(conf).makeQualified(
            new Path(binaryTokenFilename)),
        conf);
    credentials.addAll(binary);
}

// add secret keys coming from a json file
String tokensFileName = conf.get("mapreduce.job.credentials.json");
if(tokensFileName != null) {
    LOG.info("Loading user's secret keys from " + tokensFileName); // Info level logging
    String localFileName = new Path(tokensFileName).toUri().getPath();

    try {
        // read JSON
        Map<String, String> nm = JsonSerialization.mapReader().readValue(
            new File(localFileName));

        for(Map.Entry<String, String> ent: nm.entrySet()) {
            credentials.addSecretKey(new Text(ent.getKey()), ent.getValue()
            .getBytes(Charsets.UTF_8));
        }
    } catch (JsonMappingException | JsonParseException e) {
        LOG.warn("Failed to parse JSON file: " + tokensFileName, e); // Warn level logging for exceptions
    }
}
```

In this implementation:
- `LOG.info` is used to log successful loading of tokens and secret keys.
- `LOG.warn` is used to log any issues encountered during the parsing of the JSON file, which helps in debugging potential issues without stopping the application.
