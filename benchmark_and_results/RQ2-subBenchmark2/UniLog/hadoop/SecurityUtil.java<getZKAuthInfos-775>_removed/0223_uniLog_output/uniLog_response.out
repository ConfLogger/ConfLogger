To insert a log level and log verbosity message in the given target method code, we need to determine where the logging statement should be added. Based on the examples provided, logging is typically added around actions that could fail or provide useful runtime information. In this case, we can add logging around the potential failure points or key actions in the code.

Here's how you can add logging to the target method code:

```java
<Line#0>String configKey) throws IOException {
<Line#1>char[] zkAuthChars = conf.getPassword(configKey);
<Line#2>String zkAuthConf =
<Line#3>zkAuthChars != null ? String.valueOf(zkAuthChars) : null;
<Line#4>try {
<Line#5>    LOG.debug("Attempting to resolve configuration indirection for zkAuthConf"); // Log level: DEBUG
<Line#6>    zkAuthConf = ZKUtil.resolveConfIndirection(zkAuthConf);
<Line#7>    if (zkAuthConf != null) {
<Line#8>        LOG.debug("Configuration resolved successfully, parsing authentication"); // Log level: DEBUG
<Line#9>        return ZKUtil.parseAuth(zkAuthConf);
<Line#10>    } else {
<Line#11>        LOG.warn("zkAuthConf is null, returning empty auth list"); // Log level: WARN
<Line#12>        return Collections.emptyList();
<Line#13>    }
<Line#14>} catch (IOException | ZKUtil.BadAuthFormatException e) {
<Line#15>    LOG.error("Exception occurred while processing zkAuthConf", e); // Log level: ERROR
<Line#16>    throw e;
<Line#17>}
```

### Explanation
- **Line#5**: Added a debug log before attempting to resolve configuration indirection, as this is a key operation that might fail.
- **Line#8**: Added a debug log after successfully resolving the configuration, indicating that the next step is parsing the authentication.
- **Line#11**: Added a warning log for the scenario where `zkAuthConf` is null, which might be unexpected and worth noting.
- **Line#15**: Added an error log in the catch block to capture any exceptions that occur during the process, providing insight into failures.
